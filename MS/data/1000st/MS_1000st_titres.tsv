The Dust Bowl was a devastating environmental disaster that affected the Great Plains region of the United States during the 1930s. The two primary causes of the Dust Bowl were:

1. **Drought**: A prolonged period of severe drought that lasted from 1930 to 1936, which led to the depletion of soil moisture and the destruction of crops.
2. **Poor farming practices**: The widespread adoption of intensive farming techniques, such as deep plowing and monoculture, which led to soil erosion and the loss of topsoil.

These two factors combined to create a perfect storm of environmental degradation, resulting in massive dust storms, widespread crop failures, and the displacement of thousands of people"	[35, 6478, 323, 8009, 33489, 12659, 6197, 311, 33093, 20904, 382, 791, 33093, 20904, 574, 264, 33318, 12434, 21426, 430, 11754, 279, 8681, 63911, 5654, 315, 279, 3723, 4273, 2391, 279, 220, 7285, 15, 82, 13, 578, 1403, 6156, 11384, 315, 279, 33093, 20904, 1051, 1473, 16, 13, 3146, 35, 6478, 96618, 362, 44387, 4261, 315, 15748, 37846, 430, 36513, 505, 220, 7285, 15, 311, 220, 7285, 21, 11, 902, 6197, 311, 279, 92948, 315, 17614, 32257, 323, 279, 19814, 315, 31665, 627, 17, 13, 3146, 85203, 33489, 12659, 96618, 578, 24716, 25375, 315, 37295, 33489, 12823, 11, 1778, 439, 5655, 628, 24060, 323, 96157, 10745, 11, 902, 6197, 311, 17614, 58097, 323, 279, 4814, 315, 1948, 708, 321, 382, 9673, 1403, 9547, 11093, 311, 1893, 264, 4832, 13766, 315, 12434, 53568, 11, 13239, 304, 11191, 16174, 44583, 11, 24716, 19641, 28950, 11, 323, 279, 44153, 315, 9214, 315, 1274]	150	problèmes de génération
