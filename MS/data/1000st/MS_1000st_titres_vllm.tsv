839	"""Sea of Love"" by Cat Power

- Meanings: The song is about a person's longing for freedom and escape from the constraints of a relationship, finding solace in the vastness of the ocean.

- Special Memories: The song is often associated with the 2003 film ""Lost in Translation,"" where the character Bob Harris (played by Bill Murray) sings it to his wife, played by Scarlett Johansson, in a poignant moment of introspection.

- Misheard Lyrics: Some people mishear the lyrics as ""Sea of love, of a man that Brandy loved"" instead of ""Sea of love, of a man that I loved."""
